# The_Networking_Game
Flutter app programmed in Dart using Visual Studio Code, original clone of the Flutter Firebase tutorial and then modified!

This app is a work-in-progress and while it does run, it's not finished. 
If it *was* working correctly, it's a professional networking app that gamifies building your portfolio and job-related activities!

Currently getting API's to work, but planning on linking up with Indeed, LinkedIn, GitHub, and possibly more!
At the moment, I only have GitHub connected and a small amount of profile information. 

The plan is to get recent grads and job-seekers motivated by building an RPG-like achievement app
that gives you points for doing job-related tasks and building your professional network and portfolio!
